# Canon

This file records the immutable rules of your fictional world. These are the constraints that characters cannot violate without breaking the world's internal logic.

**When to update:** When you introduce or change a world rule that constrains future scenes.

---

## World Rules

### Physical Laws
<!-- Natural laws of your world -->

- [Example: Gravity is 1.2x Earth standard]
- [Example: Days are 27 standard hours]
- [Example: Atmosphere is thin (equivalent to 3000m altitude)]

### Magic System
<!-- If applicable: How magic works, its costs, limits, and rules -->

- [Example: Magic requires blood contact with runestones]
- [Example: Sanctuaries block all magic within their wards]
- [Example: Ward strength degrades 5% per day without maintenance]
- [Example: Healing magic does not work on infections]

### Technology Constraints
<!-- What technology exists, how it works, what's impossible -->

- [Example: No faster-than-light travel]
- [Example: AI is prohibited by treaty]
- [Example: Energy weapons drain power cells (30 shots per cell)]

### Biological Constraints
<!-- Physical limits of your species/characters -->

- [Example: Humans cannot survive more than 3 days without water]
- [Example: Hematocrit below 25% causes loss of consciousness]
- [Example: Telepathy range is limited to 50 meters]

---

## Historical Constraints

<!-- Fixed events in your world's history that affect the present -->

- [Example: The war ended 12 years ago (current year = 842 Post-Armistice)]
- [Example: The old capital was destroyed; no survivors]
- [Example: Breach Gates were sealed 200 years ago]
- [Example: First Contact occurred in Year 2147]

---

## Social Rules

<!-- Laws, customs, taboos that constrain behavior -->

- [Example: Sanctuary law supersedes kingdom law within ward boundaries]
- [Example: Blood oaths are binding (magical enforcement)]
- [Example: Speaking the Forbidden Tongue is punishable by exile]
- [Example: Touching royalty is a capital offense]

---

## Geographic Constraints

<!-- Fixed features of your world's geography -->

- [Example: The Dead Zone is impassable (radiation)]
- [Example: The ocean is uncrossable (storms, monsters)]
- [Example: The mountain pass closes in winter (snow)]
- [Example: Three moons visible from all latitudes]

---

## Chronology System

<!-- Document how you track time in your world -->

**Calendar:**
- [Example: 365 days per year, 12 months]
- [Example: Current year: 842 Post-Armistice (PA)]

**Time Units:**
- [Example: Standard 24-hour days]
- [Example: Chrono format in scenes: D0-T000 (Day-TimeUnit)]

## Notes

- **Be specific:** "Magic is limited" is vague. "Magic requires blood contact with runestones" is actionable.
- **Distinguish cannot from will-not:** CANON.md is for physical impossibilities, not character choices.
- **Update immediately** when you revise a world rule, then search all scenes for consistency.
- **Cross-reference:** If a scene violates CANON.md, either the scene is wrong or CANON.md needs updating.

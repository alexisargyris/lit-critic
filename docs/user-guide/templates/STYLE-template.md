# Style Guide

This file documents your novel's prose micro-rules—tense conventions, punctuation preferences, sentence structure habits, and term usage guidelines.

**When to update:** When you establish or discover a stylistic convention you want to maintain.

---

## Tense Rules

### Default Tense
[Your default narrative tense]

**Example:**
Past tense for present-time narrative.

### Flashbacks
[How you handle flashbacks]

**Example:**
Use present tense for flashbacks (inverted convention).  
Example: "Three days earlier, Amelia *stands* in the vault corridor..."

### Other Tense Uses
[Any other tense conventions]

---

## Dialogue Tags

### Default Tag
[Your preferred dialogue tag]

**Example:**
Use "said" as the default neutral tag. Avoid fancy tags ("exclaimed," "retorted," "hissed") unless the manner of speech is essential.

### Tag Placement
[Where you place dialogue tags]

**Example:**
Place tags after the first clause of multi-sentence dialogue:  
✅ "I don't know," Amelia said. "The vault was already open."  
❌ Amelia said, "I don't know. The vault was already open."

### Action Beats vs. Tags
[Your preference for action beats vs. dialogue tags]

---

## Terminology

### [Category of Terms]
[Specific rules for certain terms]

**Example:**
### Magic System Terms
- "ward" (lowercase) unless starting a sentence
- "Breach Gates" (always capitalized, always plural)
- "runestone" (one word, lowercase)

### [Your World's Terms]
- [Term]: [Rule]
- [Term]: [Rule]

---

## Punctuation

### Em Dashes
[Your em dash style]

**Example:**
Use em dashes (—) for abrupt interruptions or shifts in thought. No spaces around the dash:  
✅ "Amelia, I—"  
❌ "Amelia, I —"

### Oxford Comma
[Your Oxford comma preference]

**Example:**
Always use the Oxford comma in lists:  
✅ "Amelia, George, and Lyra"  
❌ "Amelia, George and Lyra"

### Ellipses
[Your ellipsis style]

**Example:**
Three periods with no spaces: "I don't..."  
OR: Three periods with spaces: "I don't . . ."

### Quotation Marks
[Single or double quotes, UK or US style]

**Example:**
US style: Double quotes for dialogue, single for quotes within quotes.

---

## Sentence Structure

### Sentence Length
[Your pacing preferences]

**Example:**
Vary sentence length to control pacing. Action scenes: shorter sentences. Introspective scenes: longer, more complex syntax.

### Filter Words
[Your policy on filter words]

**Example:**
Avoid unnecessary filter words ("saw," "felt," "heard," "realized") in deep POV:  
❌ Amelia *saw* the door ajar.  
✅ The door hung ajar.

### Sentence Fragments
[When you use fragments]

**Example:**
Use fragments deliberately for pacing in action scenes. Not an error when intentional.

### Passive Voice
[Your passive voice policy]

**Example:**
Prefer active voice, but passive is acceptable when the actor is unknown or unimportant:  
✅ "The vault was opened." (when you want to hide who did it)

---

## Point of View

### POV Style
[Deep, limited, omniscient?]

**Example:**
Deep third-person limited. Stay tightly in POV character's head—no external observations they couldn't make.

### POV Breaks
[How strict are you about POV?]

**Example:**
Never break POV mid-scene. If switching POV, start a new scene.

### Internal Thoughts
[Italics? No markers? Dialogue tags?]

**Example:**
No italics for internal thought in deep POV (everything is already internal).  
OR: Italics for direct internal monologue: *What am I doing?*

---

## Paragraph Structure

### Paragraph Length
[Your preference]

**Example:**
Vary paragraph length. Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis only, not default.

### Paragraph Breaks
[When you break paragraphs]

**Example:**
Break for new speaker, new beat of action, or shift in focus.

---

## Numbers and Measurements

### Spelling Out Numbers
[When to spell vs. use numerals]

**Example:**
Spell out numbers one through ten, use numerals for 11+.  
Exception: Ages, times, measurements always use numerals.

### Units of Measurement
[Imperial, metric, invented?]

**Example:**
Use metric (kilometers, meters, kilograms).  
OR: Use invented units documented in CANON.md.

---

## Capitalization

### Titles
[When to capitalize titles]

**Example:**
Capitalize formal titles when used with names: "King George."  
Lowercase when used alone: "The king arrived."

### Proper Nouns
[Special capitalization rules for your world]

**Example:**
"the Sanctuary" when referring to the specific location (proper noun).  
"a sanctuary" when referring to the concept (common noun).

---

## Repetition and Echoes

### Intentional Repetition
[When you use repetition for effect]

**Example:**
Use deliberate repetition for emphasis in critical moments.  
Avoid accidental repetition within a paragraph.

### Word Echoes
[How you handle word repetition]

**Example:**
Avoid repeating distinctive words within 50 words unless intentional.

---

## Voice and Tone

### Narrative Voice
[Describe your narrative voice]

**Example:**
Spare, terse prose for this character's POV. Long, flowing sentences for another character's POV.

### Register
[Formal, casual, period-appropriate?]

**Example:**
Modern casual register despite fantasy setting (not faux-medieval).

---

## Genre-Specific Rules

### [Your Genre] Conventions
[Any genre-specific style rules]

**Example (Fantasy):**
Introduce invented terms without immediate explanation—readers infer from context.

**Example (Hard SF):**
Explain technical concepts in-scene when characters would naturally discuss them.

---

## Personal Preferences

### Favorite Constructions
[Things you intentionally do that might seem wrong]

**Example:**
- Use semicolons to connect thematically related sentences (intentional, not run-ons)
- One-word sentences for impact: "Silence."

### Avoided Constructions
[Things you actively avoid]

**Example:**
- Never use adverbs with dialogue tags ("said softly" → "whispered")
- Avoid "suddenly" and "just" (weak intensifiers)

---

## Notes

- **Document the rule, not every instance** (you don't need to list every dialogue tag, just the policy)
- **Include examples** (show the right way and the wrong way)
- **Distinguish rules from preferences** (rules = never break; preferences = default unless there's a reason)
- **Update when you catch yourself being inconsistent**

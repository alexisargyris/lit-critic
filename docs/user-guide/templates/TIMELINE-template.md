## Non-Linear Narratives

If your narrative is non-linear, use chronological markers:

**01.02.01** **[Flashback: D-3]** Amelia and George argue about the vault.

**01.02.02** **[Present: D0-T120]** Amelia finds the ward anchor damaged.

**01.02.03** **[Flash-forward: D+7]** George's funeral. Amelia learns the truth.

---

## Parallel Timelines

If you have parallel POVs or timelines:

### Timeline A (Amelia's POV)

**01.01.01** Amelia wakes. Hematocrit 28%. George missing.

**01.01.02** Amelia searches sanctum. Finds notes.

### Timeline B (George's POV - simultaneous)

**01.01.01B** George opens the vault at dawn. Discovers it's empty.

**01.01.02B** George flees the sanctuary. Amelia will never forgive him.

---

## Guidelines

### 1. One Line Per Scene
(Two if the scene is especially complex)

✅ **01.03.01** Amelia discovers vault door ajar. George's voice from inside. Ward strength at 12%.

❌ **01.03.01** Amelia walks down the corridor. She smells rust. She sees the door. George is somewhere inside the vault, she thinks. She draws her blade and considers whether to enter or wait for backup. The wards are failing.

### 2. Focus on Outcomes
What **changed**, not what **happened**.

✅ **01.04.01** Amelia confronts George. He reveals he's dying. She agrees to help with the vault.

❌ **01.04.01** Amelia and George talk in the vault.

### 3. Include Key Facts
Numbers, states, and decisions that matter for continuity.

✅ **01.04.02** Amelia's hematocrit drops to 22%. Lyra offers transfusion. 12 soldiers arrive.

❌ **01.04.02** Amelia gets worse. Help arrives.

### 4. Use Consistent Scene IDs
Match the IDs in your scene @@META headers.

### 5. Update Prev/Next Pointers
When you insert or rearrange scenes, update TIMELINE.md and the Prev/Next fields in affected scene files.

---

## Rearranging Scenes

When you move scenes around:

1. **Update TIMELINE.md** to the new reading order
2. **Keep scene IDs stable** (don't renumber)
3. **Update Prev/Next** in affected scene files
4. **Note the change** if needed:

**[MOVED: was 01.02.05, now 01.04.01]**

---

## Planned Scenes

You can list planned scenes that aren't written yet:

**01.05.01** **[TBD]** Amelia enters the vault.

**01.05.02** **[TBD]** Vault confrontation.

---

## Notes

- **Keep this current** Update after each scene
- **Be concise** One line is enough
- **Highlight key facts** Numbers, decisions, revelations
- **This is for YOU** Helps you remember what happened without re-reading

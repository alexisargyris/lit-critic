# Threads

This file tracks narrative promises—questions raised, mysteries introduced, character arcs begun—and their current status.

**When to update:** When you open a new thread (introduce a question/promise), advance it, or resolve it.

---

## Active Threads

### [thread_id]
**Opened:** [Scene ID]  
**Question:** [What question or promise does this thread represent?]  
**Status:** [Current status—Active, Advancing, Stalling, etc.]  
**Notes:** [Latest developments, connections to other threads, planned resolution]

**Example:**
### vault_mystery
**Opened:** 01.01.02  
**Question:** What's inside the vault? Why did George hide the key?  
**Status:** Active. Amelia found the vault door ajar (01.03.01) but hasn't entered yet.  
**Notes:** Reader knows George is dying; Amelia doesn't. This asymmetry is intentional. Connected to George_secret thread.

## Notes

- **Give each thread a short ID** (e.g., `vault_mystery`) for easy reference in scene @@META
- **Record scene ID where opened**
- **Update status regularly** as you write
- **Move to "Resolved"** when the question is answered or arc completes
- **Track connections** between related threads
- **Watch for stale threads** (no advancement in 10+ scenes may feel forgotten)

---

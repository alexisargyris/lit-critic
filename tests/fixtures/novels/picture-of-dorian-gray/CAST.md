# Cast

## Dorian Gray
Alias: Prince Charming (used by Sibyl Vane).
Role: Protagonist; a wealthy, exceptionally handsome young man whose soul is supernaturally tied to a portrait.
Age: Introduced in his early twenties; he is thirty-eight at the time of Basil's murder and approximately forty at the story's end.
Status: Deceased; found dead as a "withered, wrinkled, and loathsome" old man after stabbing the portrait.
Relationships: Protégé of Lord Henry; former muse and friend of Basil Hallward; former fiancé of Sibyl Vane.
First scene: Chapter II, discovered in Basil Hallward’s studio playing Schumann on the piano.
Notes: His fateful wish causes the portrait to age and bear the marks of his sins while he remains physically youthful.

## Lord Henry Wotton
Alias: Harry.
Role: Antagonist/Mentor; an aristocratic hedonist who influences Dorian with his cynical and aesthetic philosophy.
Age: Not explicitly stated; an "old Oxford friend" of Basil Hallward.
Status: Alive.
Relationships: Friend of Basil Hallward; mentor and close friend to Dorian Gray.
First scene: Chapter I, reclining on a divan in Basil Hallward’s studio.
Notes: He is the primary source of the "New Hedonism" philosophy that dictates Dorian’s lifestyle.

## Basil Hallward
Alias: None.
Role: Artist; the painter of the fateful portrait who feels a profound, almost religious obsession with Dorian.
Age: Not explicitly stated; a contemporary and friend of Lord Henry.
Status: Deceased; murdered by Dorian Gray in a fit of rage.
Relationships: Friend and admirer of Dorian Gray; friend of Lord Henry Wotton.
First scene: Chapter I, in his studio finishing the portrait of Dorian.
Notes: He initially refuses to exhibit the portrait because he feels he has put "too much of himself" into the work.

## Sibyl Vane
Alias: None.
Role: Actress; a talented young performer whose suicide marks Dorian’s first major moral descent.
Age: Seventeen.
Status: Deceased; committed suicide by drinking poison after being rejected by Dorian.
Relationships: Former fiancée of Dorian Gray; sister of James Vane.
First scene: Chapter IV (mentioned); Chapter VII (physical appearance on stage).
Notes: She loses her ability to act convincingly because her real love for Dorian makes the "shadows" of the stage seem hollow.

## James Vane
Alias: None.
Role: Sailor; Sibyl's brother who seeks revenge against Dorian for his sister's death.
Age: Not explicitly stated; roughly twenty years younger than Dorian appears when they meet in the opium den eighteen years after Sibyl's death.
Status: Deceased; accidentally shot during a hunting party at Selby Royal.
Relationships: Brother of Sibyl Vane.
First scene: Chapter V.
Notes: He fails to kill Dorian initially because Dorian’s unaged face makes him appear too young to have known Sibyl eighteen years prior.

## Alan Campbell
Alias: None.
Role: Scientist and chemist; a former friend of Dorian’s coerced into disposing of Basil’s body.
Age: Not explicitly stated; a former close associate of Dorian.
Status: Deceased; commits suicide shortly after the events involving Basil's body.

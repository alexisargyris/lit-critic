# Canon rules (invariants)

## Paramanes

- R1.1: Paramanes are human beings engineered for the specific purpose of participating in Paraviosis sessions. 
- R1.2: Paramanes have 2 arm ports (1 for input, 1 for output) for Paraviosis; leaking ports indicate failing health. Note: patients have a single port.
- R1.3: Paramanes become productive (i.e. able to participate in Paraviosis sessions) when they reach 15 years of age; they usually die 10 years later because of the effects of Paraviosis.
- R1.4: The Κυρία can replace a failing Paramana if declining health is discovered.
- R1.5: Paramanes are either δημόσιες (public) or ιδιωτικές (private). Only wealth people can afford a private Paramana. Public Paramanes provide their services from state-owned institutions called Λαϊκά that work like brothels.
- R1.6: Paramanes may lose their public / private status due to unfortunate events. Such Paramanes are called "του δρόμου" (street). Their life expectancy is extremely low because they fall victims to forced Paraviosis (like rape). 

## Paraviosis

- R2.1: Paraviosis is required daily to prevent wounds from remaining open.
- R2.2: Blood reserves exist, both official (pharmacies) and unofficial (black market).
- R2.3: Blood access in pharmacies is constrained logistically per household.
- R2.4: Blood quality in the black market is suspect/dangerous.
- R2.5: The morning session is the most demanding from the point of view of blood supply. The number of additional sessions depends on the patient's health. People who cannot afford a private Paramana may do their Paraviosis session later in the day or not at all (but there are health consequences).

## Social

- R3.1 Religion language is a facade.
- R3.2 The State is called Archdiocese.
- R3.3 Paramanes are brought up and prepared to play their role in facilities called Monasteries.

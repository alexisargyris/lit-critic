## T1: The Supernatural Corruption of the Portrait
Description: The core plot device where Dorian Gray remains physically unaged and beautiful while a portrait painted by Basil Hallward assumes the physical burden of Dorian’s aging and the moral disfigurement of his sins.
Introduced: Chapter II, when Dorian utters the fateful wish that he might remain young while the picture grows old.
Latest touched: Chapter XX, as Dorian examines the portrait one last time, seeing no change from his "good deed" but rather a look of hypocrisy.
Expected payoff window: The final scene of the novel, where Dorian’s attempt to destroy the evidence of his soul results in his own death and the restoration of the painting’s original beauty.

## T2: The Philosophy of New Hedonism
Description: The psychological and moral influence of Lord Henry Wotton over Dorian, encouraging him to live a life of pure sensation, aestheticism, and "New Hedonism" without regard for conventional morality.
Introduced: Chapter II, during Lord Henry’s first extended conversation with Dorian in Basil’s garden.
Latest touched: Chapter XIX, where Lord Henry remains blissfully unaware of Dorian's crimes, dismissing the idea of Dorian being a murderer because "crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders".
Expected payoff window: Throughout the middle chapters (XI-XII) as Dorian’s social reputation decays, and ultimately in the final chapter where the limitations of this philosophy are realized.

## T3: The Vane Family Vengeance
Description: The external threat to Dorian’s safety following his cruel treatment and subsequent suicide of the actress Sibyl Vane; her brother James Vane vows to track down and kill "Prince Charming".
Introduced: Chapter V, when James Vane swears an oath to his sister to kill the man who harms her.
Latest touched: Chapter XVIII, when Dorian confirms that the man accidentally shot in the hunting party is indeed James Vane.
Expected payoff window: Chapters XVI through XVIII, building tension through a chance encounter in an opium den and culminating in the resolution of the physical threat to Dorian.

## T4: The Disappearance of Basil Hallward
Description: The narrative tension surrounding the murder of the artist Basil Hallward by Dorian and the subsequent cover-up involving the blackmail of Alan Campbell.
Introduced: Chapter XIII, when Dorian murders Basil in the locked schoolroom after showing him the corrupted portrait.
Latest touched: Chapter XIX, when Lord Henry mentions that Basil’s family is still searching for him and that his disappearance remains a mystery to London society.
Expected payoff window: The final chapter, when Dorian’s servants discover the "withered, wrinkled, and loathsome" body of their master beside the beautiful portrait, finally connecting the man to his hidden soul.

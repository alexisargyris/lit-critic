# Timeline

chapter 01: Lord Henry Wotton becomes fascinated by Basil Hallward’s portrait of Dorian Gray and insists on meeting the young man. Basil’s private artistic sanctuary is invaded by Lord Henry’s intrusive curiosity. Basil believes his masterpiece reveals the "secret of his own soul" and his intense "artistic idolatry" of Dorian.

chapter 02: Dorian Gray meets Lord Henry and, terrified by the prospect of aging, wishes that the portrait would grow old while he remains young. Dorian’s innocent worldview is replaced by a desperate, hedonistic vanity. Lord Henry’s philosophy of "New Hedonism" has the power to reshape Dorian's entire identity in a single afternoon.

chapter 03: Lord Henry investigates Dorian’s tragic family history and later enthralls him with a speech on the importance of youth and pleasure at a dinner party. Lord Henry commits to "scientifically" manipulating Dorian's soul to see how he develops. Dorian is a wealthy heir born from a scandalous and romantic tragedy.

chapter 04: One month later, Dorian reveals to Lord Henry that he has fallen in love with and proposed to a young actress named Sibyl Vane. Dorian has found a new obsession that he believes validates Lord Henry's theories about the beauty of the senses. Dorian loves Sibyl as a personification of art rather than as a real woman.

chapter 05: Sibyl Vane celebrates her engagement while her brother James vows to kill Dorian if he ever harms her before departing for Australia. A physical threat and a moral foil to Dorian’s carefree life are established. James Vane is deeply protective and suspicious of the upper class.

chapter 06: Dorian, Lord Henry, and Basil discuss the engagement before heading to the theater to see Sibyl perform. Basil reluctantly accepts that Dorian’s life is now guided by passion rather than art. Lord Henry views Dorian's marriage as a fascinating psychological experiment.

chapter 07: Sibyl performs poorly, causing Dorian to cruelly reject her; he returns home to find a "touch of cruelty" on his portrait. The portrait begins its supernatural transformation to reflect Dorian's moral decay. Sibyl’s real love for Dorian made her realize the hollowness of acting, which ironically destroyed Dorian’s love for her.

chapter 08: Dorian discovers Sibyl has committed suicide but is persuaded by Lord Henry to view the event as a beautiful artistic tragedy. Dorian fully suppresses his conscience and chooses a life of eternal youth and sin. Dorian values the "aesthetic" of a tragedy more than human life itself.

chapter 09: Basil visits a mourning Dorian and is shocked by his coldness; Dorian refuses to let Basil see the hidden portrait. The intimacy of Basil and Dorian’s friendship is permanently broken. Basil confesses that he worshipped Dorian with "artistic idolatry".

chapter 10: Dorian hides the changing portrait in his old, locked schoolroom to keep his soul's corruption a secret. Dorian creates a physical and symbolic divide between his public mask and his private reality. Dorian has become paranoid and distrustful of his own household staff.

chapter 11: Years pass as Dorian indulges in every possible vice and sensory pleasure, guided by a "poisonous" French book sent by Lord Henry. Dorian becomes a notorious figure of decadence whose face remains unaged while the portrait grows grotesque. Dorian uses the study of perfumes, jewels, and tapestries to distract himself from the horror of his soul.

chapter 12: On the eve of his thirty-eighth birthday, Basil confronts Dorian about his ruined reputation and demands to see his "soul". Dorian decides to reveal his secret to the one person who truly cared for him. Dorian’s influence has led several young men to social ruin and even suicide.

chapter 13: Dorian shows Basil the hideous portrait and, in a fit of uncontrollable rage, murders him with a knife. Dorian is now a cold-blooded murderer, marking his ultimate descent into evil. The portrait has become a "leperous" and "rotting" reflection of Dorian's life.

chapter 14: Dorian blackmails his former friend, chemist Alan Campbell, into disposing of Basil’s corpse. The physical evidence of Dorian's crime is erased. Dorian is willing to destroy others' lives through blackmail to protect his own skin.

chapter 15: Dorian attends a high-society dinner but struggles to maintain his composure as his guilt begins to surface. Dorian realizes that social distractions can no longer fully mask his internal terror. Dorian's behavior has become erratic and suspicious even to his peers.

chapter 16: Dorian visits an opium den and is nearly killed by James Vane, who is fooled by Dorian's youthful appearance. Dorian’s past (the Vane family) literally returns to haunt him. James has been hunting "Prince Charming" for eighteen years but did not expect him to still look twenty.

chapter 17: During a week at his country estate, Dorian faints after seeing James Vane watching him through a window. Dorian’s life becomes a waking nightmare of fear and surveillance. Dorian’s "eternal youth" is now a curse that attracts danger from his forgotten past.

chapter 18: James Vane is accidentally shot during a hunting party, and Dorian feels a surge of relief that he is safe. The immediate physical threat to Dorian's life is eliminated. Dorian’s first instinct after a death is to confirm his own safety rather than mourn.

chapter 19: Dorian tells Lord Henry he wants to be "good" now, but Henry remains cynical and reveals Alan Campbell's suicide. Dorian realizes that a single good deed cannot undo his soul’s deep corruption. Lord Henry believes it is impossible for Dorian to have committed a murder because he is too "charming".

chapter 20: Dorian attempts to destroy the portrait to find peace, but he dies instead, and the two swap their appearances one last time. Dorian is dead, and the portrait is restored to its original beauty. One cannot destroy their conscience without destroying themselves; the soul’s price must eventually be paid.
